# Sprint Timeline Breakdown

We were given 6 weeks to iterate and complete the final design, which we divided into three 2-week sprints.


### Sprint 1: MVP

**Goals:**
Assemble simple vehicle with DC motors and mecanum wheels
Create keyboard controls for vehicle movement in 8 directions using Arduino

**Purpose:** Test movement and physics of mecanum wheels.


### Sprint 2

**Goals:**
* Get stepper motors working
* Replace Arduino with Raspberry Pi
* Parse LiDAR data
* Create custom chassis to mount all parts

**Purpose:** Get LiDAR working on its own, replace MVP components with more advanced options.


### Sprint 3

**Goals:**
* Implement new (larger) stepper motors and mecanum wheels
* Integrate and test LiDAR-based navigation 
* Integrate more robust navigation algorithm
* Fix cable management
* Figure out how to improve torque/ability to drive heavy chassis
* Decide upon a vacuuming method, build it

**Purpose:** finish project


### Technical challenges:
Stepper motor controllers
