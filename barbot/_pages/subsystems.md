# Divide and Conquer
Barbot takes advantage of three very important systems: Mechanical; Electrical; Firmware. In developing the BarBot, we had to make sure that the electrical and firmware architecture was ready to recieve the motor assemblies that would carry our drink dispensing pumps.

[Mechanical](/pie-2022-03/barbot/subsystems/mechanical): In charge of pump assembly development.

[Electrical](/pie-2022-03/barbot/subsystems/electrical): In charge of creating and optimizing circuitry.

[Firmware](/pie-2022-03/barbot/subsystems/firmware): In charge or creating and optimizing the dispensing and user interface.
