# Increment Steps
Working up to the currently functioning BarBot involved building up the pump assembly, user interface electronics, motor electronics, and firmware in parallel to allow continual testing. 

Expectedly, we ran into a few hurdles in the development of each subsystem - of which the pump assembly proved to be most challenging. Having quick access to previous versions of our electronics and firmware allowed us to continuously test the pump assembly even while developing new hardware or firmware

The following is a visualization on how we evolved from the first version of Barbot in Sprint 1, to the more familiar Barbot that begins to take shape in Sprint 3. The links will take a deeper dive into what was accomplished each sprint, what went wrong, and how we hoped to improve.

## Sprints

[Sprint 1](/pie-2022-03/barbot/implementation/sprint1)

_Sprint 1: A humble start to Barbot, with only really a basic layout of the electronics and firmware working._

[Sprint 2](/pie-2022-03/barbot/implementation/sprint2)

_Sprint 2: Barbot's shape has remained pretty consistent, but now holds two pumps, with the electronics for four, and now features a maintainance mode!_

[Sprint 3](/pie-2022-03/barbot/implementation/sprint3)

_Sprint 3: Barbot has taken a new shape, new pumps have been developed, and electrical harness is ready to go in!_
