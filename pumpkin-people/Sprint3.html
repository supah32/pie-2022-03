											<h3><center><strong><u>Sprint Three Overview</u></strong></center></h3>
										</header>
										<p>At this point, our <strong>MPV</strong> was solidified as our final product. We still wanted to have a working mechanism
											that could transcribe an image onto a pumpkin, but we wanted to be more specific on what this would entail. 
											Therefore, we decided that our design should have:
											<ul>
												<li>A rotating base</li>
												<li>A Z-axis</li>
												<li>A spring-loaded marker carriage</li>
												<li>A communication system between our two motors</li>
												<li>Working limit switches</li>
												<li>A working E-stop</li>
												<li>Drawing software</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p>For the <strong>current state</strong> of our project at this point, we decided to go into more detail about what was accomplished.

													</header>
													<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Secondsprintmech.png" width="640" height="1200" alt="" /></a>
												</section>
												<p><u>For the Z-axis:</u>
													<ul>
														<li>We modified the base to house our new motor. Our original stepper motors, which were 28BYJ-48 steppers, were too weak for our setup.
															Therefore we decided to switch to Nema 17 stepper motors, which should have given us more torque and power.
														</li>
														<li>We added WD-40 lube for smoother movement along the threaded rod.</li>
														<li>We realized that the threaded rod was giving us some issues, so we proceeded to look into purchasing ad new rod, while also trying to fix the one we currently had. When examining the rod, we discovered that we had accidently
															messed up the threads while attaching our gear.
														</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												<P><u>For the Main Base:</u>
													<ul>
														<li>We were currently using a wooden block to hold up the motor retainer, and we were looking towards, 
															time-permitting, building it using a different material.
														</li>
														<li>We had lathed a spike to impale our various pumpkins. We originally used a 3D printed spike, but had issues with
															attachment (the spike kept breaking off and getting stuck inside the pumpkins). Therefore, we decided to lathe a spike,
															not only so we could do a better attachment (with epoxy), but also because we wanted the spike to
															be robust.
														</li>
														<li>We had the amazing discovery that the the original grip material that we had put on the wood base worked extrememly well, and we would not have to replace the material as previously believed.
														</li>
													</ul>

													</header>
													<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Electrical.png" alt="" /></a>
												</section>
												<p>At the time of this sprint, we had made major changes and advancements in our electical setup:
													<ul>
														<li>The upper limit switch was wired to an input pin and 5V</li>
														<li>Our E-stop was wired and working</li>
														<li>Both steppers were wired to their drivers, and the CNC shield had been <strong><u>ELIMINATED</u></strong> due to personal
														and technical complications. </li>
														<li>The drivers were wired to a step pin and a direction pin, with 5V power from the arduinofor logic, and a 9V batter for power</li>
														<li>The built-in potentiometers had been tuned for the recommended current on our stepper motors</li>
													</ul>
												</p>

														<h3><center><u>Current State Software</u></center></h3>
													</header>
												</section>
												<p>Our software had its most intense updates by the end of this sprint. At this point we had:
													<ul>
														<li>An arduino script that used the Stepper library to turn both motor at the same speed at the same time</li>
														<li>An arduino script that used the Stepper library to turn each stepper motor individually in succession to draw a square on
															the pumpkin
														</li>
														<li>An arduino script that used the AccelStepper library to turn one motor</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												<p>At this point, the next steps we had planned for our software were to:
													<ul>
														<li>Explore the AccelStepper library in order to draw slanted lines at angles other than 45 degrees</li>
														<li>Hardcode a face that can be drawn on a pumpkin of a specific diameter</li>
													</ul>

												<h3><center><u>Continued</u></center></h3>
											</header>
											<p>In terms of our <strong>biggest technical risk</strong>, we were currently struggling with the following:
											<ul>
												<li>Mechanically, we were stuggling with our rod having rough patches, and therefore our carriage would get stuck</li>
												<li>Electrically, our stepper motors kept overheating</li>
												<li>In our software, we were stuggling on finding out how to get our motors to run at different speeds at the same time efficiently</li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>At this point in our project, we finally laid to rest the idea of having a laser raster a pumpkin, and therefore our <strong>target goal</strong>
												was focused on getting the marker mechanism to work and draw a face on the pumpkin. We were experiencing issues with timing, and therefore had to pivot our idea
												to a more accomplishable goal.</p>
											<p>For our <strong>next deliverable</strong>, we hoped to have a fully functional system that could draw on a pumpkin, and to have our software fully integrated.
												<ul>
													<li>We wanted to have our software be able to draw more than a square</li>
													<li>We wanted to resolve the current issues with our motor drivers</li>
												</ul>
