										<p>At this point, our <strong>MPV</strong> plan was still to have a spring-loaded marker mechanism
										that would allow us to draw a design on a pumpkin, and our <strong>reach goal</strong> was still to have a mechanism that could
										raster an image onto a pumpkin.
										</p>
										<p>The <strong>current state</strong> of our project was as follows:
											<ul>
												<li>For our <strong>mechanical design</strong>, we had a fully functional z-axis with a spring-loaded marker carriage, though we were currently experiencing 
													some issues with the threaded rod. We also had a fully functional rotating base.
												</li>
												<li>For our <strong>electical design</strong>, we had limit switches that were wired but not yet programmed. Our motors were wired and connected to the CNC shield,
													and the power input to the CNC shield was completed.
												</li>
												<li>For our <strong>software</strong>, we only had a functioning stepper motor for the main base, which allowed the plate to spin.
												</li>
											</ul>

										<p>In terms of our <strong>biggest technical risk</strong>, we were currently dealing with risks in the software element.
											We were dealing with issues in our <strong>GRBL</strong> program, but we passed it off as us not yet understanding the program,
											and we truly believed that we just need to properly test our code and make some nessary adjustments to achieve our goals.
										</p>
										<p>At this point our <strong>target goal</strong> still had not changed, and we still hoped to integrate a laser into our design
											if time-permitting. Therefore, we hoped that by the next sprint to have our
											limit switches working, integrate in our E-stop, and also have our drawing software somewhat working.
